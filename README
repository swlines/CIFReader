CIF Reader
--

CIF Reader is a C++ parser that allows you to parse CIF files issued by Network Rail and ATCO-CIF files issued by Traveline (primarily for NPTDR imports).

It is very kludgy, and needs a lot of improvement, but it works - mostly. Report bugs in the normal manner, please - they can be tested on the test library that @poggs has on his TSDBExplorer github repo.

** The current release contains Network Rail CIF parsing only **

CIF Parser requires:
  - Boost, at least version 1.33 (may be earlier, that's what I have)
  - uuid/uuid.h
  - mysqlpp (custom compile - need to run ./configure with --with-field-limit=35)

To use it, you will need to create a SQL database, and run the SQL queries that are included in timetables.sql. In addition, you will need to add your database username, password, database and server settings to classes/CIF.cpp - or uncomment #include<databaseConfig.h> and put this in there…and fill it in:

const char* sqlUsername = "";
const char* sqlPassword = "";
const char* sqlDatabase = "";
const char* sqlServer = "";

I haven't included a Makefile, but this is the command I personally use:
$ g++ -Wall -I/usr/include/mysql -I/usr/local/include/mysql++ -I/usr/include/boost -lmysqlclient -lmysqlpp -luuid -lboost_regex -o parser main.cpp

Usage: Just call ./parser <the file you want to read>
